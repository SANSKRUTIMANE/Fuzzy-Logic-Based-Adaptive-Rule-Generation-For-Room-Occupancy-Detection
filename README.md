# Fuzzy-Logic-Based-Adaptive-Rule-Generation-For-Room-Occupancy-Detection
Designed and implemented a fuzzy logic-based algorithm capable of autonomously generating and refining rules for IoT datasets related to room occupancy detection in smart environments on the basis of certain factors like light, temperature, CO2 levels,etc.
